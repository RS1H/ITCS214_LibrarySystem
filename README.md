# Library System (Java) â€“ Fixed Version

**Same structure as your code**, but with the real bugs fixed so it stores data correctly and deletes safely.

## What was fixed
- Constructors & setters now assign fields with `this.field = param;` (previously they assigned nothing).
- `addMember` checks for duplicates using `membersList.contains(member)` instead of `membersList.equals(member)`.
- Safe deletion using an `Iterator` inside `deleteBook` / `deleteMember` (avoids concurrent modification).
- Typos in `toString()` (`Title`, `CPR`) and null/empty safety for second author.
- Kept your manual counters (`booksListSize`, `membersListSize`) so the public API stays identical.
